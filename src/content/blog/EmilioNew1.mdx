**OpenAI Artificial Intelligence Generates Realistic Animations Automatically**

**The AI Could be a Animation Engenieer'**
OpenAI has developed a new artificial intelligence model capable of generating realistic animations at
from text descriptions. This breakthrough could revolutionize the animation industry by significantly reducing the time and
the costs associated with creating animated content. The model can produce fluid movements and precise details, making much of the
manual work of traditional animators becomes obsolete.

ora lands at a critical moment for these programs. Experts have expressed concern that AI-generated content could be used to wrongly influence elections or otherwise sow confusion worldwide.
The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2024 listed AI-generated misinformation and disinformation as the most significant risk facing the world in the next two years.
In addition to working with red teamers to identify risks Sora could pose, OpenAI is building classifiers that could alert users if a video was generated by Sora and plan to include C2PA metadata,
imperceptible additions to the files containing AI-generated content that would allow provenance verification, if they deploy Sora in a product, according to the blog post accompanying Sora’s release.
