**Julián Packheiser, Neuroscientist: "If You Like to Be Touched, You Should Seek It More Often"**

**EL PAÍS Salud y Bienestar**

Touch is a fundamental aspect of human interaction and well-being. Julián Packheiser, a neuroscientist, explains the importance of physical touch and how it can significantly impact our mental and physical health. In an interview with _EL PAÍS_, Packheiser emphasizes that those who enjoy being touched should actively seek it more often for its numerous benefits.

Packheiser's research highlights the role of touch in releasing oxytocin, a hormone associated with bonding and stress reduction. Physical touch, such as hugs, handshakes, or a pat on the back, can enhance feelings of connection and reduce anxiety. In today's digital age, where face-to-face interactions are often limited, the importance of physical touch becomes even more pronounced.

**The Science Behind Touch**

Studies have shown that touch can activate the brain's reward system, releasing dopamine and serotonin, which are chemicals that promote happiness and well-being. Regular physical contact can also lower cortisol levels, helping to mitigate stress and its associated health risks. For individuals who enjoy touch, seeking it more frequently can lead to improved mood, reduced feelings of loneliness, and better overall health.

**Benefits of Physical Touch**

1. **Emotional Support**: Physical touch provides comfort and reassurance, helping to alleviate feelings of sadness and isolation.
2. **Improved Relationships**: Touch strengthens social bonds and fosters a sense of trust and intimacy in relationships.

3. **Healthier Heart**: Regular touch has been linked to lower blood pressure and a healthier heart, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

4. **Boosted Immune System**: Positive physical interactions can enhance immune function, making the body more resilient to infections.

**Practical Ways to Incorporate More Touch**

1. **Hug More**: Don't shy away from giving and receiving hugs. They are a simple yet powerful way to connect with others and boost your mood.

2. **Handshakes and High-Fives**: These gestures are common in many cultures and can be a quick way to establish rapport and show appreciation.

3. **Massage**: Regular massages can not only relax muscles but also provide the benefits of sustained physical contact.

4. **Pet Interaction**: Spending time petting animals can provide similar benefits to human touch, especially for those who might feel isolated.

Packheiser encourages people to be mindful of their need for touch and to seek it in appropriate and consensual ways. He also notes that not everyone is comfortable with physical contact, and it's essential to respect personal boundaries.

**Conclusion**

Physical touch plays a crucial role in maintaining mental and physical health. For those who enjoy being touched, seeking out more opportunities for physical contact can lead to numerous health benefits and improve overall well-being. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, remembering the value of human touch is more important than ever.
