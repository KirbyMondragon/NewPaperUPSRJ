**Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**
While working as a software development project manager in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Bianca Trinkenreich often wondered why she was one of the few women in the room. This curiosity led her to NAU as a Ph.D. student, where she had the opportunity to seek answers.

**At NAU, Trinkenreich joined assistant professor Igor Steinmacher's**
Software Engineering Research Laboratory, investigating women's underrepresentation in open-source software development. Her research revealed that women, despite having the same technical skills as men, faced harsher evaluations. Anonymously submitted code from women was better received than when names were attached, indicating bias.

Trinkenreich's dissertation, which delved into these inequalities, earned her the prestigious dissertation award from the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Software Engineering. She is the first Brazilian and Latin American to receive this honor, awarded annually to just one Ph.D. graduate globally.

Her journey into studying diversity was unplanned, sparked by a research assistant opportunity with Steinmacher, a fellow Brazilian. At NAU, she dedicated herself to making software engineering more inclusive, starting with a comprehensive review of previous research on inequality in open-source software.

Trinkenreich attributes current inequalities to the male-dominated origins of the industry. She highlights the absence of HR inclusion guidelines in many open-source projects as a significant factor contributing to women's exclusion and unfair treatment.

In her dissertation, she proposed various strategies to make open-source software communities more inclusive. These include featuring women and minorities in recruitment materials, showcasing successful women's stories on company platforms, and exposing young girls to coding early on to foster their interest in tech.

Now a postdoctoral scholar at Oregon State University, Trinkenreich takes pride in her dissertation's impact. She credits NAU's inclusive focus for guiding her to form a diverse dissertation committee, enriching her research. Through her work, she aims to raise awareness about the importance of diversity in tech, encompassing age, tenure, race, ethnicity, and gender identity.

"I feel like I'm giving back to women, and to all the students and professors I learned from during my time at NAU," Trinkenreich said. "I hope it opens people's eyes to what it means to do research on all the aspects of diversity."
