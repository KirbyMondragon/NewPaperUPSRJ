**Five AI-Assisted Films Stir Controversy at Annecy, the World's Largest Animated Film Festival**

**EL PAÍS Culture**

The Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the world's largest event dedicated to animated cinema, has found itself at the center of a heated debate this year. The controversy revolves around five films created with the assistance of artificial intelligence, raising questions about the role of AI in the creative process and the future of animation.

These AI-assisted films have sparked a wide range of reactions from festival attendees and industry professionals. Supporters argue that AI technology can enhance creativity and streamline production processes, allowing filmmakers to explore new artistic possibilities. Critics, on the other hand, express concerns about the potential loss of human touch and originality in animated works.

One of the contentious films, titled _The Machine's Dream_, utilizes AI algorithms to generate unique visual styles and narratives. The film's director, who chose to remain anonymous, believes that AI can be a powerful tool for artists, offering new ways to experiment and innovate. However, traditional animators fear that the increasing reliance on AI could undermine the value of their craft and lead to job displacement.

The debate at Annecy highlights the broader conversation about the impact of AI on various creative industries. As technology continues to advance, the balance between human creativity and machine assistance remains a pressing issue. While some see AI as a valuable collaborator, others worry about the ethical and artistic implications of its use.

Festival director Marcel Jean addressed the controversy, stating, "Annecy has always been a platform for pushing the boundaries of animation. We welcome the dialogue and encourage filmmakers to explore new technologies while respecting the art form's rich history and traditions."

As the festival progresses, the discussions surrounding AI in animation are expected to continue, reflecting the evolving landscape of the film industry. Whether AI will be embraced as a revolutionary tool or resisted as a threat to artistic integrity remains to be seen.
