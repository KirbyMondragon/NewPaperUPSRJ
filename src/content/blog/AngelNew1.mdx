**The 90 Years of Donald Duck: Why Disney's Grumpiest Character Has Successfully Survived**

**María Porcel**

It was 1931 and Donald's name was mentioned in an illustrated book called _The Adventures of Mickey Mouse_; there was also a duck on the back cover of it. Three years passed until, now a character, Donald appeared in a short film titled _The Wise Little Hen_. He was going to be a secondary character, but it was soon seen that his comedic outlook made him the protagonist. From there, more short films, appearances, books, vignettes... and the rest is history.

Although Mickey Mouse is the undisputed king of what is called the house of the mouse, Disney, which has become an international conglomerate with dozens of brands listed on the stock market and is worth around $200 billion, has the white duck like a prince, second in command. Now that he turns 90, they have decided to celebrate the many successes he has given them by opening their studios in Burbank (north of Los Angeles, in California) to _EL PAÍS_ and explaining the secrets of his long-standing success.

How has a duck dressed in a blue jacket, a red bow tie and always without pants become a symbol of the house of princesses, heroes and villains? Those who have been at Disney for years, watching it, are clear about it. The personality of the doll has created great followers. While Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, Pluto, Goofy... are affable, good-humored, affectionate, Donald is grumpy. He gets angry, screams, kicks, literally climbs the walls. That is to say: he is human. And that, in a world of animated perfection, is something to note. Those who have watched these little dolls for years, some decades, know the secrets of their success.

The duck has changed very little over the years; At first it had a longer beak and the colors were somewhat different, but little more. That has also made his image almost evergreen. In addition to the many tasks to which he has dedicated himself. “In the 1930s and 1940s he was very popular in cartoons and comics... especially until Uncle Scrooge arrived,” he recalls, something that happened in 1952. “In the 1940s he was a very important character in the United States because he dedicated himself to positive propaganda during the war. He earned up to 400 military insignia,” explains Cline, showing a figure of Admiral Donald Duck, “already much more than a simple sailor,” he laughs again. “He represented the Government and Defense, and in 1943 he starred in a campaign to encourage paying taxes, a war effort. In the fifties he was dedicated to public service, teaching safety to children,” says the Disney history expert.

The nonagenarian Donald has participated in 11 Oscar-nominated films. And beyond his image and his bad temper, what many remember is his voice. “It's very difficult to imitate,” admits Becky Cline. Today, in the United States, it is Tony Anselmo who lends him his throat. He apprenticed with Clarence Nash, Donald's original voice, who taught him in the '80s. Nash died in 1985 and since then he has been the only official voice of the duck and considered “a Disney legend” by the animation house itself. Right now, Anselmo doesn't train anyone. He is also not willing to tell his secrets: “If I told you, I would have to kill you,” he laughs. “It's a business secret. It’s all in the mouth.” He does recognize that the way he positions himself when speaking “is not a voice as such”: “I don't use the vocal cords, I can do it even with pharyngitis,” he acknowledges. And he loves what he's been doing for 40 years. “It's something I'm very protective of, because it comes from Walt, and I respect him. I want to maintain that tradition, that legacy, not change it. He is not broken, so we don't have to change anything, right?”
