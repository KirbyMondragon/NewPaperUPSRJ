**Four Exercises to Improve Posture and Reduce Pain**

**Gemelas Bienestar**

Having good posture is more important than we think: it helps develop strength, flexibility, and balance throughout the body. And no less important is that this can generate less muscle pain and more energy during the day.

Additionally, some studies find that proper posture can also reduce stress on muscles and ligaments, which can reduce the risk of injury. And there are mental health benefits too: a 2017 study suggests that upright posture can help increase positive affect, decrease negative self-focus, and reduce fatigue in people with mild to moderate depression.

**Exercise 1: Arm Raises**
Lying on the floor, resting on the soles of our feet and bending our knees, we bend our arms with our hands at head height and join them above the head. Then we separate them and keep the elbows at 90ยบ at chest level. We repeat the sequence 10 times.

**Exercise 2: Shoulder Squeeze**
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Clasp your hands behind your back and pull your shoulders back, squeezing the shoulder blades together. Hold for 5 seconds and release. Repeat 10 times.

**Exercise 3: Cat-Cow Stretch**
Start on your hands and knees. Inhale as you drop your belly towards the mat, lifting your chin and chest and gazing up toward the ceiling (Cow Pose). Exhale as you draw your belly to your spine and round your back towards the ceiling (Cat Pose). Repeat 10 times.

**Exercise 4: Chest Opener**
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Extend your arms straight out to the sides with your palms facing forward. Slowly pull your arms back as far as they will go, feeling the stretch in your chest and shoulders. Hold for 5 seconds and release. Repeat 10 times.

Once we have finished this first series, there are two more to complete the training proposed by the Pin Twins to improve posture and reduce aches and pains in the back.

**Benefits of Good Posture**

- **Strength and Flexibility**: Good posture helps develop strength, flexibility, and balance throughout the body.
- **Reduced Pain**: Proper posture can generate less muscle pain and more energy during the day.
- **Injury Prevention**: Reduces stress on muscles and ligaments, decreasing the risk of injury.
