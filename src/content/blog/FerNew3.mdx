**The Sensation of Vertigo Can Be Due to a Stroke**

**Jesus Alvares**

The sensation of vertigo, that dizzying feeling of the world spinning around you, can have various causes. However, one of the more serious potential causes of vertigo is a stroke. Jaime Ruiz, a renowned neurologist, explains the connection between vertigo and strokes, and what you should know to protect yourself.

Vertigo is often associated with inner ear problems, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or Meniere’s disease. These conditions are usually treatable and not life-threatening. However, when vertigo is accompanied by other symptoms, it can indicate something more serious.

**Symptoms to Watch For**

When vertigo occurs alongside other symptoms, it might be a sign of a stroke. These symptoms include sudden severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body, difficulty walking, and loss of coordination. If you experience any of these symptoms with vertigo, it’s crucial to seek medical attention immediately.

**Understanding the Risks**

Strokes can occur when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to severe complications or even death if not treated promptly.

**Jaime Ruiz emphasizes the importance of recognizing the signs of a stroke and acting quickly.** "Time is brain," he says, highlighting that the faster you get treatment, the better your chances of recovery. Immediate medical attention can significantly reduce the risk of long-term damage.

**Preventive Measures**

To reduce the risk of stroke, it is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This includes managing blood pressure, keeping cholesterol levels in check, controlling diabetes, avoiding smoking, and staying physically active. A balanced diet and regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can also help you stay on top of your health.

**Conclusion**

While vertigo can often be attributed to less serious conditions, it is important to be aware of the symptoms that may indicate a stroke. Early recognition and treatment are vital for the best outcomes. If you or someone you know experiences sudden vertigo with other stroke symptoms, seek medical help immediately.
