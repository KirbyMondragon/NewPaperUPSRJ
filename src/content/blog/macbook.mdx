**In Sálvese quien pueda, Andrés Oppenheimer sounds a dire warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. .**

The book portrays a world where technology is advancing at breakneck speed, and robots, automation, and algorithms threaten to consume millions of jobs worldwide. With a provocative and direct tone, Oppenheimer exposes the harsh reality of a world where 47% of current jobs could disappear in the coming decades.

## Review

In this regard, Sálvese quien pueda finds a disturbing reflection in OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, the AI model that's revolutionizing how we interact with technology. GPT-4 Turbo has proven itself capable not only of replacing routine work but also of infiltrating creative and cognitive professions. From drafting reports and writing scripts to providing basic legal advice, this model is rewriting the rulebook.

## OpenAI

The comparison between Oppenheimer's book and the rise of GPT-4 Turbo rings out as a terrifying warning: artificial intelligence isn't just shaping the future—it's already here, taking jobs, automating processes, and rendering thousands of professionals obsolete. Sálvese quien pueda is not just a catchy title but an urgent rallying cry for a future where traditional education and conventional careers no longer guarantee job security.

Through interviews with tech gurus, entrepreneurs, and AI experts, Oppenheimer explores how the tech revolution is disrupting the global economy. He leaves us with a stark warning: adapt or perish in a world dominated by tireless robots, unfailing algorithms, and models like GPT-4 Turbo that are reshaping the labor landscape faster than anyone could have imagined.
